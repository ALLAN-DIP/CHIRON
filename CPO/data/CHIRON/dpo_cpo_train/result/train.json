I think probably what would work best is if you and Germany go west while Turkey and I contain and/or eat Russia, then once I've picked up some Russian dots and gotten some good position, you split your fleets to help me take Turkey and help Germany take England.'  Message from ITALY:'I like that. Let me talk it over with Germany.'  Message from ITALY:'I\u2019m not sure whether Germany is keen on attacking France. Perhaps you and I should focus on Turkey?'
