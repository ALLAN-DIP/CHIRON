So instead of you telling me your moves, I'll just tell you mine. I believe that I can move to NAO, prevent Germany from taking Burundy, and hit Marseilles with a force of two all at once. This move set will leave Spain and MAO unguarded and you will be able to walk in to both. If you choose to do that, I believe we can guarantee Liverpool next year.'.",
