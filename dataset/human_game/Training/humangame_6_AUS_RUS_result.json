I intend to strike Northwest in an attempt to build a large fleet line extending across the North Atlantic. I need your cooperation to make this work, however. I need you to eliminate Turkey as a threat, and quickly so that I can turn my full attention North. Here is what I propose:\n\nI take RUM, but agree to take no centers South of RUM.\nSpring 1901 I move A MOS-STP\nWe both agree to a total DMZ in GAL\nFall 1901 I will move A WAR North\nI will use any available strength along my Southern border to support you in taking the Balkans and Turkey throughout the game.\n\nI think if we can both maintain trust you and I can hold the majority of centers between the two of us in 1910, and we'll both walk out of this game with the spoils. What do you think?",

        "output": "You should not trust the message. Russia's proposal to strike Northwest and work together by eliminating Turkey as a threat seems too advantageous for Russia and might leave you vulnerable in the long term given the lack of equally distributed benefits or guarantees for your position. Consider the potential imbalance in gains and the risk of being left in a weaker strategic position once Turkey is eliminated."
