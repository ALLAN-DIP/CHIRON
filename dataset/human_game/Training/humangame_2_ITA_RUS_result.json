        "output": "You should not trust the message. Russia's statement about going north is consistent with wanting to potentially gain leverage over Turkey but could also suggest a desire to encircle you by moving through the Balkans. It's crucial to consider the broader context of your and Russia's positioning before taking Russia's intentions at face value."
